## 🚀✨ 🚩 Releases

### 🍨 🛍📦 Types
releases are divided in two categories :
 - **pre-release** *aka experimental releases* introduce new features or rewrite implementations.
 Even if always tested before publishing, it's possible that something included fail to work.
 We expect from advanced adventurous users to test these releases .
 
 - And when a *pre-release* is considered enough tested and stable, it become the **latest release**.
 Its safer to run theses releases because supposed to include less bugs .
 Even if late bug discovery still possible it will be fix as soon as possible in another follow-up release.

### ⏳⏰📅 Schedule
Releases are published when ready,
resulting in non-predictable schedule.
Usually a *pre-release* publication is happening when there is enough stuff that needs to be tested.
And it becomes the *latest release* if no bugs are found by enough testers after enough time.

### 🏷️ 🔖 👀 Versioning
All releases are maintained with The [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/).
Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.
